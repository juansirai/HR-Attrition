Organizations are maded of people. Inside the company, we can find individuals with different backgrounds, experiences and with different objetives. 
Sometimes, what the individual wants for him or her career, is aligned with the organization objetives. In that case, the person is able to pursuit his/her personal objetive, while following the organization one. In other times, the organizational objetive is not aligned with the individual one, so he or she may enter in an internal conflict.

Since organizations are people working following a main objetive, is not crazy to affirm that they are the most valuable asset. People working in different possitions, add value while working, and sometimes they are the visible face of the bussiness.

When someone enter in a company, is needed to spend time in a good onboarding, trainings, and development of him or her skills. It's a big investment, and sometimes is not seen as that. Because of that, when an employee decide to quit, it's a **double loss**: social and economical... so it is really important to understand the main causes, and think in solutions to avoid lose our best employees.

The **new paradigm in organizations**, include people from different ages and way of thinking working side by side, new knowledge and technology, new ways of work (presential, remote, etc), and a fast enviroment never seen before.

Organizations often put a lot of effort into desperate "talent retention" strategies but ... maybe it's time to think and rethink, in strategies with a long-term goal: *"build the conditions so that people want to stay."*

If you want, I invite you to follow me in this trip, triying to get the first insights about "Why people left their jobs?", and think in ways to don't lose our main value.
